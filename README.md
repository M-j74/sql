👋 Hi, I'm Mariam — Data Engineer in the Making
I specialize in building clean, scalable data solutions using SQL, ETL pipelines, and data warehouse architecture. My GitHub showcases real-world business logic, automated workflows, and reusable code designed for analytics and reporting.
🔍 What you'll find here:
- SQL scripts for data cleaning, CASE logic, and window functions
- Python-powered ETL pipelines with logging, error handling, and CSV ingestion
- Data warehouse designs with fact/dimension tables, automated columns, and performance-tuned queries
- Portfolio projects that simulate client scenarios, from retail analytics to KPI dashboards
💡 I believe in writing code that’s not just functional—but robust, reusable, and ready for production. Whether you're a fellow developer, recruiter, or curious learner, feel free to explore, fork, or reach out.
